Common examples of inclusive broader impacts are programs that help women, people of color, and people with disabilities advance in STEM fields. A broader impact is classified as `universal` if anyone could at least in theory benefit from it. Public goods such as improving primary school teaching practices or developing a better municipal water filter are examples of universal impacts. A broader impact is classified as `advantaged` if the primary benefit will be experienced by advantaged groups and/or maintain status hierarchies. Scientists, as well as wealthy people and institutions count as advantaged. The second dimension, immediacy, refers to the centrality of the broader impact to the main part of research project.

Training graduate students is a quintessential direct broader impact. For most research grants, training a graduate student is not the purpose of the research.

A broader impact is `intrinsic` if the broader impact is inherent to and inseparable from the main principal purpose of the grant. For example, if a project is developing carbon capture and sequestration technology, the research and societal benefits of reducing greenhouse gases overlap and thus the broader impact is intrinsic to the project. Some broader impacts are `extrinsic`. These broader impacts are separate from the main intellectual merit of the research project, and often the project is only tenuously related to it. For example, if a cell biologist studying proteins creates a presentation for a local high school about STEM careers, the broader impact is extrinsic.

Philip Isett A Proof of Onsager’s Conjecture for the Incompressible Euler Equations Abstract: In an effort to explain how anomalous dissipation of energy occurs in hydrodynamic turbulence, Onsager conjectured in 1949 that weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations may fail to exhibit conservation of energy if their spatial regularity is below 1/3-Hölder. I will discuss a proof of this conjecture that shows that there are nonzero, (1/3-epsilon)-Hölder Euler flows in 3D that have compact support in time. The construction is based on a method known as \"convex integration,\" which has its origins in the work of Nash on isometric embeddings with low codimension and low regularity. A version of this method was first developed for the incompressible Euler equations by De Lellis and Székelyhidi to build Hölder-continuous Euler flows that fail to conserve energy, and was later improved by Isett and by Buckmaster-De Lellis-Székelyhidi to obtain further partial results towards Onsager's conjecture. The proof of the full conjecture combines convex integration using the “Mikado flows” introduced by Daneri-Székelyhidi with a new “gluing approximation” technique. The latter technique exploits a special structure in the linearization of the incompressible Euler equations. Sylvia Serfaty Mean-Field Limits for Ginzburg-Landau vortices Abstract: Ginzburg-Landau type equations are models for superconductivity, superfluidity, Bose-Einstein condensation. A crucial feature is the presence of quantized vortices, which are topological zeroes of the complex-valued solutions. This talk will review some results on the derivation of effective models to describe the statics and dynamics of these vortices, with particular attention to the situation where the number of vortices blows up with the parameters of the problem. In particular, I will present new results on the derivation of mean field limits for the dynamics of many vortices starting from the parabolic Ginzburg-Landau equation or the Gross-Pitaevskii (=Schrodinger Ginzburg-Landau) equation. I will also discuss the situation with disorder and related homogenization questions. Luis Silvestre Integro-differential equations and their applications. Abstract: Integro-differential equations have been a very active research topic in recent years. In these talks, we will start by explaining what they are and reviewing some basic results related to general problems. Then we will move on to some applications of these results to problems of mathematical physics. In particular, we will discuss some recent regularity estimates for the Boltzmann equation. Manuel del Pino Singularity formation in critical parabolic problems Abstract: We deal with construction and stability analysis of blow-up of solutions for parabolic equations that involve bubbling phenomena, corresponding to gradient flows of variational energies. The term bubbling refers to the presence of families of solutions which at main order look like scalings of a single stationary solution which in the limit become singular but at the same time have an approximately constant energy level. This phenomenon arises in various problems where critical loss of compactness for the underlying energy appears. Specifically, we present construction of threshold-dynamic solutions with infinite time blow-up in the Sobolev critical semilinear heat equation in the n-dimensional space, and finite time blow up for the harmonic map flow from a two-dimensional domain into the sphere."}]}}

Species geographic distributions information is used intensely in a broad range of research efforts in biogeography, systematics, ecology, conservation, global change biology, and more. Species distribution evidence also supports governments, agencies, and companies to make sound decisions regarding resource management, protecting human health, and conserving biodiversity. The importance of species distribution knowledge continues to amplify as species shift their distributions in response to rapidly changing climate and habitats.   Over the course of the past four project years supported by NSF, Map of Life (http://mol.org, MOL) has developed into a global resource for species distribution information, providing an initial set of integrated range data together with several mapping, analysis, and reporting tools. From a prototype it has over this period developed into an authoritative infrastructure and resource for researchers, citizen scientists, educators and the broader public. Building on a powerful and scalable web platform geared for “big” biodiversity and environmental data, MOL brings together a range of species distribution data types from a wide array of sources. A number of visualization and reporting tools build on this uniquely comprehensive and growing compilation, with significant use by US and global communities in research, education, conservation and policy. To date, the main MOL products and tools include:   - Species maps (https://mol.org/species). Integrated maps composed of multiple data types are currently available for over 100,000 species, with data originating from hundreds of data sources, many of which mobilized by the project. The species map pages provide a visual integration (with remote-sensing supported model-based combination proposed for the next phase) together with publicly available images and text. These visually integrated range maps are shared with and adopted by global taxonomic and thematic networks, such as Amphibiaweb (e.g. https://goo.gl/aAR4aj) and Future Earth’s Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA).   - Datasets overview (https://MOL.org/datasets). Provides a search, browsing, and mapping interface for all occurrence data types.   - Regional species information (https://mol.org/regions). Provides information about the species occurring in a range of different region types, including administrative areas, mountains (developed in partnership GMBA) and user defined areas.    - Spatial biodiversity patterns (https://mol.org/patterns). These pages provide aggregate map summaries for a growing set of taxa and addressing different diversity facets.     - Biodiversity indicators (https://mol.org/indicators). These present initial products for the three indicators developed under the auspices of the GEO Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON, http://geobon.org/) for national reporting against multiple 2020 Aichi Targets (goo.gl/bcqc6P). They have since been selected as core indicators by IPBES (http://www.ipbes.net/) and been adopted in the core CBD process (http://goo.gl/mhQKoR). These indicators also showcase MOL’s successful close collaboration with Google Earth Engine team (http://goo.gl/Lk3qs8). These examples, and the demand from the science and policy communities highlight their strong interest for spatial biodiversity research products, and the unique position and opportunity for MOL to address this need.   - Conservation and Outreach Tools and Products. Together with the Field Museum and the African Conservation Center, MOL has advanced dashboards supporting conservation decision-making (https://mol.org/watersheds; http://biodiversityatlaskenya.org/map). MOL has partnered with the EO Wilson Biodiversity Foundation to leverage Map of Life products for the Half-Earth Project – for outcomes of the first phase of this partnership see http://www.half-earthproject.org/maps/ .   - MOL mobile app (https://MOL.org/mobile#/). Provides MOL-driven “what lives around” species information for hand-held devices. The app has seen well over half a million user sessions since 2015 and was featured by Science Magazine and named 2016 Best App for Teaching & Learning by the American Association of School Librarians (http://goo.gl/NATFQc).   - Others. A range of additional tools addressing data sharing, expert feedback, quality control, species distribution modelling, and distribution change prediction are currently under development or targeted for the next project phase.   The listed products and tools highlight the range of MOL’s intellectual contributions and broader impacts. The MOL team has communicated core research results emerging from this work in a range of high-profile journal publication that saw wide press coverage. Team members have also presented extensively in conferences and through press releases, and the PI has engaged in IPBES and GEO BON processes as expert, lead author, and working group lead. The project has trained a number of research assistants, informaticians, PhD students, and postdocs and qualified them for the next career steps, including several tenure track faculty positions.  In sum, while some of the most significant impacts will only be realized in the next project phase, the four-year support have served to establish MOL as a key platform for an improved accounting, reporting, and use of species distribution information. Potential beneficiaries range from scientists across the biological, environmental and social sciences to environmental management and policy, to educators and the broader public."}]}}

The first steps of NER are performed by three proteins: UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC. The UvrA•UvrB (AB) ensemble recognizes damaged DNA, and cooperates with UvrC and other factors to repair DNA. In prior work, we have developed a model that explains three incompletely understood mechanisms of NER: 1) discrimination of native from damaged DNA by UvrA, 2) the role of nucleotide dynamics in NER, and 3) localization of UvrB to the lesion. Below, we apply structural, biochemical, and physical biochemical methods to test this model.    The specific aims/objectives of this study for the project period are:       1) How does UvrA discriminate damaged from native DNA? We have shown that UvrA adopts two structural states, designated open and closed, with significantly different DNA binding surfaces (open: wide and shallow, closed: narrow and deep). We propose that these states allow for damage recognition, and will use single-molecule fluorescence to determine if UvrA cycles between these states during discrimination. These studies will be complemented by biophysical and structural analyses to determine the fundamental basis of discrimination. 2) How does UvrA change in structure in response to nucleotide? Our hypothesis is that one of UvrA’s two ATP binding sites, the proximal site, governs interactions between UvrA and UvrB, DNA, and that the second site, the distal site, is involved in opening and closing of UvrA. To better understand the role of ATP, we will determine structures of UvrA in various nucleotide states. The predicted unique properties of the open and closed states of UvrA will be analyzed via biochemical analysis of each state trapped by disulfide crosslinking. Mutant proteins will be used to understand how changes in nucleotide state impact the function of UvrA. 3) How do UvrA and UvrB cooperate to process DNA damage? Our hypothesis is that UvrA in the AB complex contacts lesion-DNA first, is then evicted, whereupon two copies of UvrB translocate and assemble a dimeric entity at the lesion. To understand this choreography, we will use biophysical methods to determine positions of UvrA and UvrB relative to the lesion. These studies will be complemented by X-ray structures of AB complexes on damaged DNA.     Our three peer-reviewed papers contributed to a better understanding of the molecular events associated with the early steps of nucleotide excision repair as mediated by the UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins. In addition, our collaborative work enabled routine single particle CryoEM sample and grid characterization by tomography. Four trainees contributed to the reported science, including, one high school student, one undergraduate student, one master's student, and one doctoral student. In addition to science, the PI partnered with four high schools in New York City to engage students (grades 9-12) in STEM. These are: 1) The Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation (UASWC, Bronx, NY), 2) Hunter High School (Manhattan, NY), and 3) the A. Philip Randolph Campus High School (Manhattan, NY), and 4) The New Explorations into Science, Technology, and Math (NEST+M) High School (Manhattan, NY). Students in these high schools come from groups underrepresented in science. The PI’s involvement consists of a) hosting high-school interns, b) visits for career days at high schools, c) tours of science facilities at CCNY, e) judging science fairs, and f) collaborations with teachers on course development.     The PI is a co-organizer of the New York Structural Biology Discussion Group. This group organizes two meetings each year (January and August) which bring together ~300 - 400 structural biologists from the New York City region for a day-long meeting. The PI, with colleagues at CCNY (Professors Christine Li, Biology and Professor Renata Miller, English), initiated a program titled “Opportunities in Research and the Creative Arts” (ORCA).

The specific aims/objectives of this study for the project period are:       1) How does UvrA discriminate damaged from native DNA? We have shown that UvrA adopts two structural states, designated open and closed, with significantly different DNA binding surfaces (open: wide and shallow, closed: narrow and deep). We propose that these states allow for damage recognition, and will use single-molecule fluorescence to determine if UvrA cycles between these states during discrimination. These studies will be complemented by biophysical and structural analyses to determine the fundamental basis of discrimination. 2) How does UvrA change in structure in response to nucleotide? Our hypothesis is that one of UvrA’s two ATP binding sites, the proximal site, governs interactions between UvrA and UvrB, DNA, and that the second site, the distal site, is involved in opening and closing of UvrA. To better understand the role of ATP, we will determine structures of UvrA in various nucleotide states. The predicted unique properties of the open and closed states of UvrA will be analyzed via biochemical analysis of each state trapped by disulfide crosslinking. Mutant proteins will be used to understand how changes in nucleotide state impact the function of UvrA. 3) How do UvrA and UvrB cooperate to process DNA damage? Our hypothesis is that UvrA in the AB complex contacts lesion-DNA first, is then evicted, whereupon two copies of UvrB translocate and assemble a dimeric entity at the lesion. To understand this choreography, we will use biophysical methods to determine positions of UvrA and UvrB relative to the lesion. These studies will be complemented by X-ray structures of AB complexes on damaged DNA.     Our three peer-reviewed papers contributed to a better understanding of the molecular events associated with the early steps of nucleotide excision repair as mediated by the UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins. In addition, our collaborative work enabled routine single particle CryoEM sample and grid characterization by tomography. Four trainees contributed to the reported science, including, one high school student, one undergraduate student, one master's student, and one doctoral student. In addition to science, the PI partnered with four high schools in New York City to engage students (grades 9-12) in STEM. These are: 1) The Urban Assembly School for Wildlife Conservation (UASWC, Bronx, NY), 2) Hunter High School (Manhattan, NY), and 3) the A. Philip Randolph Campus High School (Manhattan, NY), and 4) The New Explorations into Science, Technology, and Math (NEST+M) High School (Manhattan, NY). Students in these high schools come from groups underrepresented in science. The PI’s involvement consists of a) hosting high-school interns, b) visits for career days at high schools, c) tours of science facilities at CCNY, e) judging science fairs, and f) collaborations with teachers on course development.     The PI is a co-organizer of the New York Structural Biology Discussion Group. This group organizes two meetings each year (January and August) which bring together ~300 - 400 structural biologists from the New York City region for a day-long meeting. The PI, with colleagues at CCNY (Professors Christine Li, Biology and Professor Renata Miller, English), initiated a program titled “Opportunities in Research and the Creative Arts” (ORCA). The ORCA program promotes faculty-student engagement by bringing undergraduate research and creative works, from science to humanities to the arts, to parts of City College where such activity was previously unknown."}]}}

This will require a significant increase in food production which, in its self, will be challenged by an ongoing reduction in arable land available for agriculture. In addition, current high crop yields are driven by fertilizer application, with attendant issues of pollution, and so forth. In this regard, the problem of fertilizer availability will also need to be resolved, especially with respect to essential, and non-renewable nutrients, such as phosphorus (P). As crop breeding programs have generally been conducted on plants supplied with high levels of fertilizer, current high-yielding varieties perform poorly under limiting fertilizer applications, especially low levels of applied P.   A solution to this problem will require breeding of crop plants having high nutrient use efficiencies, matching those displayed by non-domesticated plant species.  To achieve this goal, it will be necessary to understand the manner in which a plant recognizes and responds to nutrient limiting conditions within the soil into which its root system is growing. Studies by plant biologists are addressing the signaling processes that take place at the root level, as well as the whole-plant level.  With funding from the present grant, our laboratory explored the role of the plant vascular system in serving as a long-distance communication channel between the shoot and root systems of the plant. To this end, cucurbits, such as pumpkin, cucumber and watermelon were used as a model plant system, as the content of their vascular system could be easily acquired by a simple surgical method.  Plants were grown in soil containing adequate levels of inorganic P, and then the root system of each test plant was given a P-stress treatment; control plants were given a treatment with the normal P level in the soil. Subsequently, vascular samples (functionally equivalent to blood samples) were collected, at various times after the imposition of the P-stress treatment, and analyzed for changes in composition of signaling macromolecules (proteins and RNAs) being transported to the developing regions of the plant. Our studies established that when the cucurbit root system experienced a change in P availability, shortly thereafter, a dramatic change occurred in the molecular composition of the signaling agents being transported through the vascular system. Further, by sampling the vascular system at various locations along the axis of the plant, we discovered an underlying mechanism exists to target sub-populations of RNA to specific plant organs, such as the shoot apex, developing leaves and roots.  These studies established that the plant vascular system is the first to respond to a change in P-accessibility within the soil. The newly generated set of information macromolecules enters the vascular system for targeted delivery to specific developing tissues.

This will require a significant increase in food production which, in its self, will be challenged by an ongoing reduction in arable land available for agriculture. In addition, current high crop yields are driven by fertilizer application, with attendant issues of pollution, and so forth. In this regard, the problem of fertilizer availability will also need to be resolved, especially with respect to essential, and non-renewable nutrients, such as phosphorus (P). As crop breeding programs have generally been conducted on plants supplied with high levels of fertilizer, current high-yielding varieties perform poorly under limiting fertilizer applications, especially low levels of applied P.   A solution to this problem will require breeding of crop plants having high nutrient use efficiencies, matching those displayed by non-domesticated plant species.  To achieve this goal, it will be necessary to understand the manner in which a plant recognizes and responds to nutrient limiting conditions within the soil into which its root system is growing. Studies by plant biologists are addressing the signaling processes that take place at the root level, as well as the whole-plant level.  With funding from the present grant, our laboratory explored the role of the plant vascular system in serving as a long-distance communication channel between the shoot and root systems of the plant. To this end, cucurbits, such as pumpkin, cucumber and watermelon were used as a model plant system, as the content of their vascular system could be easily acquired by a simple surgical method.  Plants were grown in soil containing adequate levels of inorganic P, and then the root system of each test plant was given a P-stress treatment; control plants were given a treatment with the normal P level in the soil. Subsequently, vascular samples (functionally equivalent to blood samples) were collected, at various times after the imposition of the P-stress treatment, and analyzed for changes in composition of signaling macromolecules (proteins and RNAs) being transported to the developing regions of the plant. Our studies established that when the cucurbit root system experienced a change in P availability, shortly thereafter, a dramatic change occurred in the molecular composition of the signaling agents being transported through the vascular system. Further, by sampling the vascular system at various locations along the axis of the plant, we discovered an underlying mechanism exists to target sub-populations of RNA to specific plant organs, such as the shoot apex, developing leaves and roots.  These studies established that the plant vascular system is the first to respond to a change in P-accessibility within the soil. The newly generated set of information macromolecules enters the vascular system for targeted delivery to specific developing tissues. We deduce that the function of these new signaling molecules is to readjust the cellular processes, in the target tissues, to allow growth to proceed in the presence of reduced P levels.   In this manner, the plant vascular system functions to orchestrate P homeostasis, at the whole-plant level. Future studies on the nature and function of these vascular-delivered long-distance signaling molecules should provide knowledge applicable to the breeding of plants with abilities to grow in soils with suboptimal levels of P available, whereby acceptable yield levels can be maintained."}]}}

Of all the habitats being affected by land conversion and climate change, wetlands are simultaneously among the most important and most impacted, with effects particularly hard-felt in arid areas where water is already a limited resource. The wetlands of the Great Plains--the prairie potholes of the northern Great Plains and playas of the southern Great Plains--are breeding, overwintering, and migratory stopover habitats for wildlife, but losses of these wetlands from land conversion and climate change compromise the ability of wildlife to disperse between patches of suitable habitat. We examined this habitat network to establish links among climatic drivers and habitat connectivity. Building from a Category 1 project that used networks of prairie wetlands as model systems for studying the influence of climatic drivers on landscape habitat connectivity, we expanded our focus by examining effects of land use/land cover change as well as climate change on connectivity among prairie wetlands and their associated biota. Both birds and amphibians are sentinels of environmental change, so we focused on responses by birds and amphibians to changes in prairie wetland networks as a function of land cover change and climate change. We combined observed historical climate data, global climate model historical and future simulations, high-resolution empirical statistical downscaling models, satellite outputs, and advanced statistical analyses to generate information that can be used to assess the impact of climate forcing on wetland connectivity and to quantify the impacts of human-induced change on drought risk and vegetation cover across the region. We found increased projected frequency of drought conditions across the region, particularly in summer, and increased global mean temperatures. We built a predictive model of vegetation cover that incorporated modes of natural variability, such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation, as well as seasonal and long-term temperature trends. For all major vegetation types in the region, three-month cumulative precipitation had the strongest influence on summer vegetation. Summer monthly maximum temperature played an important role eastern Texas and Oklahoma, moderated by Atlantic and Pacific teleconnections over inter-annual time scales. We found measures indicative of stressed and dry vegetation, particularly for grasslands relative to other land types, which have potentially important implications for the regional agroeconomy as well as native ecosystems.  Hydrologic modeling was indispensable in approaching the question of wetland landscape connectivity because there is not enough satellite imagery to capture the full range of variability exhibited by Great Plains wetland landscapes in response to climatic variables. We refined Liu and Schwartz's Prairie Complex Hydrologic Model (PCHM) to simulate the number of wetlands within a given area on a monthly time step, which we then used to examine relationships among precipitation, hydrological parameters, and wetland density, which were then related to wetland-associated bird populations. Using monthly precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and average temperature, the PCHM simulated surface water dynamics; we then used downscaled climate projections to predict wetland density and population changes in six focal bird species by 2099.  Prior to our work, it was unknown how many playas have lost their capacity to hold water, and how those losses may impact organisms traveling within and through the playa network. We used a time series of satellite images to document losses of playa wetlands associated with land conversion, and used graph theory to examine how landscape connectivity for playa-associated wildlife is impacted by these losses. We found that wetland network topology differed as much with scale as with drought, indicating that critical thresholds in connectivity arose from synergistic effects of dispersal ability (spatial scale) and habitat availability (wet vs. dry periods). We then quantified fluctuations in the status of playas in supporting connectivity through the wetland network. We ranked playas as stepping-stones, cutpoints, and hubs during regionally wet, dry, and average periods of precipitation, and for dispersal distances representing a range of species’ vagilities, to provide baseline dynamics within an area likely to experience disrupted connectivity due to anthropogenic activities. There were very few playas that were consistently important in maintaining connectivity through the network, posing a significant challenge for conservation. Management to maintain connectivity for wildlife will need to move beyond a patch-based focus to a network focus by including connectivity as a dynamic landscape property.   Overlaid on this was projected land cover in future land conversion scenarios, which allowed us to link functional connectivity to climate, land cover, hydrology, and biology, necessary knowledge for wildlife management in future landscapes and climates. Playa hydroperiod was affected by surrounding land use, with those playas that never held water over a 4-year examination period being surrounded by significantly more cropland and less grassland than those playas that were wet at least once. In contrast, playas in urbanized settings had prolonged hydroperiods."}]}}

At the same time, global scale modeling studies are beginning to suggest that 'ecoclimate teleconnections' may link the fates of forests across regions and even continents. For example, we previously published findings that large scale afforestation - the inverse of forest die-off - may lead not only to locally significant warming, but, intriguingly, also to increased energy transfer between northern and southern hemispheres, a northward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and significant increases in drought in the Amazon of South America. This poses the question: will continued North American tree die-off also lead to north-south shifts in the ITCZ and effects in Amazonia? And could current large-scale deforestation in South America, potentially exacerbated by future dieback of Amazon forests, affect climates in temperate North America via similar ecoclimate teleconnections? INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Two critical uncertainties need to be addressed to test whether this teleconnection hypothesis is realistic: (i) the effect of changes in vegetation cover and structure on biosphere-atmosphere energy exchange, and (ii) the responses of vegetation cover and structure to climate-induced tree mortality. This category 1 Macrosystems Biology project explored this high-risk idea. We synthesized data from existing networks and from our own “rapid assessment” campaigns in North and South American forests, and analyzed model experiments with simulated forest loss to test whether large-scale loss of trees could plausibly effect the opposite hemisphere’s climate and vegetation through changes in atmospheric circulation. We found that different mechanisms controlled the climate response to forest loss depending both on where the forest loss occurred and where the teleconnections caused climate and thus ecosystem impacts.  BROADER IMPACTS: Through this project the participants produced 15 publications, with resulting media coverage (Washington Post, New York Times, Scientific American Podcast), and organized sessions at conferences. It additionally supported communication through two art installations. The project trained and supported 2 postdocs, 1 PhD student, and 2 undergraduate research opportunities (REUs), all from groups traditionally under-represented in STEM fields (women, first generation, and/or Latino or Pacific Islander)."}]}}

A broader impact is classified as `advantaged` if the primary benefit will be experienced by advantaged groups and/or maintain status hierarchies. Scientists, as well as wealthy people and institutions count as advantaged. The second dimension, immediacy, refers to the centrality of the broader impact to the main part of research project. Some broader impacts are `extrinsic`. These broader impacts are separate from the main intellectual merit of the research project, and often the project is only tenuously related to it. For example, if a cell biologist studying proteins creates a presentation for a local high school about STEM careers, the broader impact is extrinsic. The outreach to high school students is a separate endeavor that takes place outside, or is extrinsic to, the research. Along the immediacy dimension, a broader impact is classified as `direct` if its impact flows directly from the research but is not the specific goal of the research. Training graduate students is a quintessential direct broader impact. For most research grants, training a graduate student is not the purpose of the research. Rather, researchers train graduate students in order to complete a research project. The training is directly related to the research, but it is not the point or purpose of the research. A broader impact is `intrinsic` if the broader impact is inherent to and inseparable from the main principal purpose of the grant.

At the same time, global scale modeling studies are beginning to suggest that 'ecoclimate teleconnections' may link the fates of forests across regions and even continents. For example, we previously published findings that large scale afforestation - the inverse of forest die-off - may lead not only to locally significant warming, but, intriguingly, also to increased energy transfer between northern and southern hemispheres, a northward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and significant increases in drought in the Amazon of South America. This poses the question: will continued North American tree die-off also lead to north-south shifts in the ITCZ and effects in Amazonia? And could current large-scale deforestation in South America, potentially exacerbated by future dieback of Amazon forests, affect climates in temperate North America via similar ecoclimate teleconnections? INTELLECTUAL MERIT: Two critical uncertainties need to be addressed to test whether this teleconnection hypothesis is realistic: (i) the effect of changes in vegetation cover and structure on biosphere-atmosphere energy exchange, and (ii) the responses of vegetation cover and structure to climate-induced tree mortality. This category 1 Macrosystems Biology project explored this high-risk idea. We synthesized data from existing networks and from our own “rapid assessment” campaigns in North and South American forests, and analyzed model experiments with simulated forest loss to test whether large-scale loss of trees could plausibly effect the opposite hemisphere’s climate and vegetation through changes in atmospheric circulation. We found that different mechanisms controlled the climate response to forest loss depending both on where the forest loss occurred and where the teleconnections caused climate and thus ecosystem impacts.  BROADER IMPACTS: Through this project the participants produced 15 publications, with resulting media coverage (Washington Post, New York Times, Scientific American Podcast), and organized sessions at conferences.

This project combined new mathematical models with experiments and surveys of disease outbreaks in natural populations to explore how food web and community interactions may influence disease spread, using Daphnia (a small, ecologically important aquatic invertebrate) and a fungal pathogen. The work explored how disease dynamics were influenced by temperature, competitors, food resources, and host immunity. The work demonstrated the role of water temperature on both the host (how fast they encounter the parasite) and the parasite (how infective it is at different temperatures). Field and laboratory experiments disentangled the impacts of how competitive ability of the host and susceptibility of the parasite are related, and how the relationship between those traits influences disease spread. The 'black box' of immune defense in this system was open and demonstrated significant variation in a host's ability to fight infection in a range of environmental conditions. The project quantified the role of both rapid changes in the genetic structure of the host population and environmental-driven changes in the host (phenotypic plasticity) in driving disease dynamics. It also demonstrated that the diet hosts consume while exposed to parasites has large effects on whether they get infected; this area of research is now spurring drug discovery work aimed at finding new medicines to fight fungal diseases.  This project also enhanced training opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers, with particular focus on members of underrepresented groups and undergraduates working at the interface of mathematics and biology. In addition to the training of undergraduate and graduate students, the investigators worked with non-governmental organizations, high schools, local park districts, a program for middle school girls, a Spanish language school, and the Detroit Zoo to disseminate results and train future scientists with hands-on projects."}]}}

A broader impact is classified as `advantaged` if the primary benefit will be experienced by advantaged groups and/or maintain status hierarchies. Scientists, as well as wealthy people and institutions count as advantaged. A broader impact is classified as `universal` if anyone could at least in theory benefit from it. Public goods such as improving primary school teaching practices or developing a better municipal water filter are examples of universal impacts.

Some broader impacts are `extrinsic`. These broader impacts are separate from the main intellectual merit of the research project, and often the project is only tenuously related to it. For example, if a cell biologist studying proteins creates a presentation for a local high school about STEM careers, the broader impact is extrinsic. The outreach to high school students is a separate endeavor that takes place outside, or is extrinsic to, the research. A broader impact is `intrinsic` if the broader impact is inherent to and inseparable from the main principal purpose of the grant.

This project combined new mathematical models with experiments and surveys of disease outbreaks in natural populations to explore how food web and community interactions may influence disease spread, using Daphnia (a small, ecologically important aquatic invertebrate) and a fungal pathogen. The work explored how disease dynamics were influenced by temperature, competitors, food resources, and host immunity. The work demonstrated the role of water temperature on both the host (how fast they encounter the parasite) and the parasite (how infective it is at different temperatures). Field and laboratory experiments disentangled the impacts of how competitive ability of the host and susceptibility of the parasite are related, and how the relationship between those traits influences disease spread. The 'black box' of immune defense in this system was open and demonstrated significant variation in a host's ability to fight infection in a range of environmental conditions. The project quantified the role of both rapid changes in the genetic structure of the host population and environmental-driven changes in the host (phenotypic plasticity) in driving disease dynamics. It also demonstrated that the diet hosts consume while exposed to parasites has large effects on whether they get infected; this area of research is now spurring drug discovery work aimed at finding new medicines to fight fungal diseases.  This project also enhanced training opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers, with particular focus on members of underrepresented groups and undergraduates working at the interface of mathematics and biology.

[2] Bessel Beam sheet (BB) using an axicon lens for clarified neural tissue samples (Fig. 1). [3] Spatial Light Modulator-based Bessel Beam sheet (SLM-BB) for whole-brain dynamic imaging (Fig. 3). These microscopes are fully operational for numerous scientific applications. The first two microscopes (OpenSPIM and BB) are in CNSI’s user facility and have been used extensively by a dozen researchers.   SLM-BB has been extensively utilized for their research, providing vital feedback to its optimization. The OpenSPIM is based on Gaussian sheet illumination, and optimized to study embryonic development of model animals with minimum photo toxicity.  The BB system is optimized to generate a > 1mm long Bessel beam with a diffraction limited width, which is ideal for scanning large-volume (> 1 cm3) CLARITY-treated biological samples.  Figure 2 shows preliminary results of a clarified mouse brain (from the Dan Geschwind Lab, labeled with Thy-1 YFP).   (A) shows a 2.4 × 2.4 × 1 mm3 volume consisting of 36 individual scans of a small 3D volume each 0.4 × 0.4 × 1 mm3. The 3D volume image is projected on to a 2D plane for convenience based on maximum intensity per depth. (B) is a magnified view of a region of the hippocampus.  (C) is a bundle of nerve fibers (labeled with ALEXA488) across the surface of a clarified mouse heart (from Dr. Tompkins). Our latest development, SLM-BB, is based on an SLM (Spatial Light Modulator) to generate multiple Bessel beams.  As shown in Figure 3, left panel, the beam starts from 488/532-nm DPSS CW lasers, then is modulated to form Bessel beams on the SLM. Next, a pair of galvo mirrors scan the beams laterally and axially. Finally, the beams are focused onto the biological sample.  Figure 3’s center panel is the same SLM-BB viewed from the front to show the dual detection arms. Emitted fluorescence lights from the sample are mapped onto two sCMOS cameras (Hamamatsu Flash 4.0) for dual-color imaging. We have achieved a Bessel beam longer than 1 mm and narrower than 1 μm.  It has produced preliminary dynamic 4D data of freely behaving C. elegans’ neural networks, shown in Figure 4. Ultra-fast 3D volume acquisition at 10 volumes/s enabled observation of more than a hundred dynamic neurons in C. elegans, marked by GCaMP6 (QW1217). Three flashing neurons (marked by red, orange, and blue circles) are clearly visible within a second, while its head was swinging left and right, indicating that these neurons are associated with the commander motor neurons for head motion."}]}}

Rather, researchers train graduate students in order to complete a research project. The training is directly related to the research, but it is not the point or purpose of the research. A broader impact is `intrinsic` if the broader impact is inherent to and inseparable from the main principal purpose of the grant. For example, if a project is developing carbon capture and sequestration technology, the research and societal benefits of reducing greenhouse gases overlap and thus the broader impact is intrinsic to the project. Some broader impacts are `extrinsic`. These broader impacts are separate from the main intellectual merit of the research project, and often the project is only tenuously related to it. For example, if a cell biologist studying proteins creates a presentation for a local high school about STEM careers, the broader impact is extrinsic. The outreach to high school students is a separate endeavor that takes place outside, or is extrinsic to, the research.

These microscopes are fully operational for numerous scientific applications. The first two microscopes (OpenSPIM and BB) are in CNSI’s user facility and have been used extensively by a dozen researchers.   SLM-BB has been extensively utilized for their research, providing vital feedback to its optimization. The OpenSPIM is based on Gaussian sheet illumination, and optimized to study embryonic development of model animals with minimum photo toxicity.  The BB system is optimized to generate a > 1mm long Bessel beam with a diffraction limited width, which is ideal for scanning large-volume (> 1 cm3) CLARITY-treated biological samples.  Figure 2 shows preliminary results of a clarified mouse brain (from the Dan Geschwind Lab, labeled with Thy-1 YFP).   (A) shows a 2.4 × 2.4 × 1 mm3 volume consisting of 36 individual scans of a small 3D volume each 0.4 × 0.4 × 1 mm3.

The focus of this project was on the role of PATELLINS (PATLs) in establishment of these patterns. The PATLs are related to proteins first discovered in yeast (Sec14) that play diverse roles in membrane trafficking (the movement of membrane parcels within and out of cells), as well as cell communication pathways. Because membrane trafficking is known to be critical for development of vein patterns we have explored the function of PATL proteins in this process. Using mutants that are unable to produce functional PATLs we have determined that several PATLs are required for production of a complex and continuous vein network during embryogenesis and also contribute to development of xylem water conducting cells during differentiation. We have also used mutants to investigate interactions between PATLs and other proteins involved in vascular patterning. Through these studies we have identified potential partners for the PATLs as they influence establishment of the vascular system.   Broader impacts: This work has been carried out at Wellesley College, a private liberal arts college devoted to the undergraduate education of women and committed to diversity. This grant has provided research training opportunities for ten Wellesley undergraduate students and two recent Wellesley graduates, who worked in the laboratory as post-baccalaureate research fellows.

Although Adansonia is a relatively small and cohesive genus, determining species delimitations and relationships among species are complicated by life history events, including polyploidy and introgression. Complex geographic patterns of morphological variation have further obscured relationships.

One such association is the lichen. At least 15,000 species of fungi develop a lichen following contact with green algae or cyanobacteria, hence lichenization is considered a highly successful trophic strategy for fungi, with lichens occurring in virtually all habitats around the world. Most fungi are invisible to the naked eye for much of their life, as their body consists of microscopic filaments, hidden in the soil, the living or dead bodies they consume, and their presence is revealed by the development of exposed fruiting body. Not surprisingly, much of fungal biodiversity remains thus to be discovered. By contrast, lichens typically occur on their substrate (e.g., rock, soil or trees) and hence their diversity was for the most part thought to be well estimated.  Intellectual merit: Our biodiversity surveys, based on integrated inferences from genetic and morphological traits, tackled several lineages within the Peltigerales, with a focus on the Lobariaceae. Within the focal genus Sticta, we have described a new species from the imperiled Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain of eastern North America and a new species from the hypermaritime regions of northwestern North America, two rare and endangered species strengthening the uniqueness of the North American lichen flora. The East Africa islands of Madagascar, Mauritius and Reunion, harbor 26 new species, with some species restricted to individual mountains of Madagascar. Much of this diversity had remained unnoticed because only five distinct lichen thalli could be recognized (Figs. 1?4). Thus, multiple fungi form morphologically virtually identical lichen associations. Similarly, the survey of the American populations assigned to the species Pseudocyphellaria crocata, a conspicuous lichen widely collected for its bright yellow pigment, revealed that this species, originally described from Asia, and thought to be virtually cosmopolitan, was in fact absent from the New World, but represented instead by 13 distinct species. While for the most part this reflected that the broad morphological variation attributed to a single species could instead be broken down into discrete combinations that each defined a species, some lichens that differed conspicuously in their reproductive structures, and were on this basis considered formed by distinct species, appear to be established by one fungus. Consequently, high morphological variation of lichen thalli is typically revelatory of the heterogeneity of the species, and individual lichen-forming fungi can switch their mode of reproduction, and develop lichen association that look different! Thus, the diversity of lichen forming fungi remains poorly understood, and the richness of our natural heritage, even in well-explored regions such as the United States, remains largely underestimated, which leads to the risk of accepting local or regional extinction with the assumption that the species is widespread, when in fact it may be geographically highly restricted. Such dramatic change in estimates of species diversity, has critical implications for our understanding of the ecology of lichens and their conservation needs. These studies unraveling a hidden diversity throughout the world, questioned the notion that lichens are old and evolutionarily static lineages. Instead the evolutionary history of lichens, at least in the Peltigerales is marked by migration, rapid diversifications, shifts, expansions (generalism) and contractions (specificity) in selection of photosynthetic partners, as well as associated bacteria and other fungal partners inhabiting the lichen, and perhaps transfer of genetic tools from other organisms through, for example, hybridization. Some of these processes are well documented in flowering plants, birds and other animals but remained ignored for less charismatic, less conspicuous organisms, for they were assumed to be more primitive and thus evolutionarily more stagnant! Thus, the processes underlying the extant diversity of lichen-forming fungi reflect a highly dynamic nature of these lineages, and complex evolutionary processes, common perhaps to all branches of the tree of life. Broader impacts. The collaborative project focused on enhancing our understanding of the diversity and the evolution of the genus Stictaand its relatives within the Peltigerales, provided significant training and learning opportunities for postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students in evolutionary biology, in particular of lichen forming fungi and their partners. Furthermore, lichen blindness, that is the lack of awareness of lichen diversity even in areas where they are abundant and diverse, was addressed through nature walks in New England and eco-tourism activities in Southern South America. Here, the visitors to the southernmost forests dominated by only four species of trees but hosting many species of lichens, including many Lobariaceae, were engaged in discovering the nature of the colorful mats draping trees and rocks, or lining the forest floor, through guided tours and various printed guides to the miniature forests of the region."}]}}

Here, the visitors to the southernmost forests dominated by only four species of trees but hosting many species of lichens, including many Lobariaceae, were engaged in discovering the nature of the colorful mats draping trees and rocks, or lining the forest floor, through guided tours and various printed guides to the miniature forests of the region."}]}}

Based on these findings, we next made some fundamental observations about the actions of estrogens on the brain of juvenile males. The way that estrogens influenced the firing activity of auditory neurons was different whether males were in the earliest 'sensory' phase of development (when they are hearing songs only) vs. when they were older and had entered the 'sensorimotor' phase of development (when they are practicing their own version of songs). For these neurons, estrogens dampened auditory responses to song in sensory animals, while they enhanced auditory responses to song in sensorimotor animals. This difference in mode of action aligns well with the boundary between memorization and practice of new sensorimotor skills, and provides a new layer of understanding about how estrogens may support learning and memory.

These findings have been disseminated to the scientific community through 6 peer-reviewed publications and 10 conference presentations to date, with 3 additional manuscripts in late stages of preparation for submission to peer-review journals. Our experimental manipulation of rainfall and burrowing rodent presence provided evidence that activities of animals strongly affect plant community responses to climate change. For example, kangaroo rat presence buffered the plant community against rainfall-induced reductions in species diversity. We found a strong lagged effect of precipitation on plant composition, and kangaroo rat burrowing amplified these precipitation legacy effects by promoting the dominance of grasses that were also favored by rainfall, whereas kangaroo rat foraging buffered against these effects by selective foraging on grasses. In analyses spanning taxonomic groups, we found that precipitation altered the strength and even the direction of species interactions. Thus, changes in precipitation from year to year may weaken species interactions over time, thereby increasing ecosystem stability and resilience to climate change. Likewise, our system-wide analysis documenting the responses of 423 species of plants, arthropods, birds, reptiles, and mammals to California’s drought of 2012-15 revealed that responses of most species were surprisingly weak despite strong community-aggregated responses. Locally rare species were more likely to increase and abundant species were more likely to decline in response to drought, and this negative density-dependence was remarkably consistent across taxa. While extreme droughts can lead to substantial short-term declines in the abundance and diversity of species across taxonomic groups, our findings indicate these disturbances may play a vital role in the long-term maintenance of biodiversity by inducing periodic die-offs of dominant species and subsequent opportunities for rare yet fast-growing species. Together, these findings highlight processes that shape community structure in highly variable environments and provide insights into whole-community responses to climate volatility. Broader impacts—This project provided training and professional development to 104 people: 93 student interns and volunteers (including 3 REU students), 7 technicians, 1 project manager, 2 postdoctoral researchers, and 1 contract biologist. Nearly all (96/104) trained personnel were from groups underrepresented in the sciences (women and minorities). This was the first postdoctoral position for both Deguines and Grinath, who gained experience with fieldwork, new analytical techniques, manuscript preparation, and grant writing. Both have moved on to new postdoctoral research positions. All 3 REU students presented their independent research at professional conferences, and REU student Brianna Doran obtained permanent employment as a wildlife biologist for the Carrizo Plain National Monument. All personnel obtained valuable hands-on ecological research experience, including unique opportunities such as handling of endangered mammals and exposure to a variety of survey methods for multiple taxonomic groups. Many personnel also obtained valuable experience with project management, data management, data analysis, and report writing, and several students and technicians have obtained permanent positions in the conservation field or gone on to graduate school. Findings from the study have contributed to K-12 education through a first-grade science book about Prugh’s kangaroo rat research (“Nighttime Investigation”) that was distributed as part of a new science curriculum by AmplifyScience to elementary schools nationwide in fall 2017.
